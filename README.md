 ## Idea

 ## Exercise from John Smilga's course, where several simple React projects are taught.

 ## Functionalities:

    API access;
    
    Use of useState Hook to create array with API items;

    Conditional operator.
    
 
 ## React Icons
  
    [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

  
  
 
 ## Changes regarding the course design:

    New css variables were created, changing the colors of the site, texts, buttons and icons and changing;
   
    Changing the page title to "FAQ About Login" because I found it more trivial.
